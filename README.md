# daily-python-studies

Daily Python. Clean code, thoughtful comments, real physics/math.  
Building mastery the quiet way.

I solve one problem a day — not for streaks or LeetCode rank, but to get better at writing code I’d be proud to ship. Every solution is tested on edge cases, commented like production, and refined until it feels right.

## Highlights

| Problem                       | What I practiced                                          |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Pong ball prediction          | Vector physics, perfect wall + corner bounces             |
| Max divisor score             | Parsing ints to set and count keys                        |
| Search insert position        | Divide and conquer tactics to parse only what is needed   |
| Targeted_sum                  | Using a dictionary to compare compliments                 |
| Maximum Value                 | Raising and handling Errors and Try/Except blocks         |
| +  more everyday              | Grid traversal, date logic, algorithms, clarity           |

All solutions are deliberately minimal, readable, and production-style.
