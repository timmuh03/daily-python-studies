# daily-python-studies

Daily Python. Clean code, thoughtful comments, real physics/math.  
Building mastery the quiet way.

I solve one problem a day — not for streaks or LeetCode rank, but to get better at writing code I’d be proud to ship. Every solution is tested on edge cases, commented like production, and refined until it feels right.

## Highlights

| Problem                     | What I practiced                                       |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Pong ball prediction        | Vector physics, perfect wall + corner bounces          |
| +  more everyday            | Grid traversal, date logic, algorithms, clarity        |

All solutions are deliberately minimal, readable, and production-style.

## About me
