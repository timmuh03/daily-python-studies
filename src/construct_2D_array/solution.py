Docstring for tests.test_construct_2D_array

You are given a 0-indexed 1-dimensional (1D) integer array original, and two integers, m and n. 
You are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional (2D) array with  m rows and n columns using all the elements from original.

The elements from indices 0 to n - 1 (inclusive) of original should form the first row of the constructed 2D array, 
the elements from indices n to 2 * n - 1 (inclusive) should form the second row of the constructed 2D array, and so on.

Return an m x n 2D array constructed according to the above procedure, or an empty 2D array if it is impossible.

Constraints:

1 <= original.length <= 5 * 104
1 <= original[i] <= 105
1 <= m, n <= 4 * 104
